You are the green pixel.\
You move forward by typing the characters/words next to you. In the picture above, you could start typing the characters `e`, `q`, `u`, `a` and `t` to move downwards or `s`, `h`, `e`, `r` and `i` to move upwards.
Empty pixels between words can be crossed by typing ⎵ (Space).

If you get stuck in a dead end or just want to go back, press ⌫ (Backspace) like you would normally delete characters.

That's it, now you can play!

This game is web-based and can be played directly in the browser.
